Student management  Web Application

This is my second Django-based web application, developed during my learning at an institution. In this app, users can:

Create 📝: Add new tasks with a title and description. Edit ✏️: Modify existing tasks. Delete 🗑️: Remove tasks from the list. The app is built with a focus on responsiveness and uses the following technologies:

Django 🖥️ (for backend functionality) Python 🐍 (for logic and data handling) HTML 🌐 and CSS 🎨 (for frontend structure and styling) Bootstrap 💼 (for a responsive and modern design)
